idea
- sleek but minimalistic Django web app used to track spending and generate stats

- supermarket receits are scanned / photographed and data is extracted using computer vision algorithms and OCR libraries
  - the first version will not have this feature so it will rely on manual data input 
  - all data pulled from the images will be validated and sanitised
  - data read: store name and location, time, date of purchase, items, quantity, price, total price 
    - (individual prices and the total price are used to validate the OCR's accuracy)
  - items are stored in a MySQL DB
- tracks week to week spending and how often certain items show up
  - creates a shopping list taking into account the frequency of item purchase
- communicates using a telegram bot using a simple API - for the picture input and list output, generating stats
